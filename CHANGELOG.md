The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Position parameters are now 0-indexed** across all MCP tools
  - Tools that accept `line`/`character` inputs (`find_implementation`, `find_references_strict`, `rename_symbol_strict`, `get_hover`, `prepare_call_hierarchy`, `get_incoming_calls`, `get_outgoing_calls`) now expect 0-indexed values, matching the LSP wire protocol directly
  - Formatted output positions (e.g. `file.ts:10:5`, `Line 10, Column 5`) are also 0-indexed
  - The internal `- 1` / `+ 1` translation layer between MCP and LSP has been removed

## [0.6.1] - 2025-10-20

### Enhanced

- **find_references Tool Documentation**: Clarified tool descriptions and parameters
